%% ltuthesis.cls Example
%% =============================================================================
%% This is an example LaTeX file that shows how the 'ltuthesis.cls' file is 
%% used. Most of the code should be self-explanatory. There are a couple of
%% known issues in the template, have a look at the top of the class file and/or
%% the TODO.md file.

%% Setup the Bibliography
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The bibliography is handled by bibunits which creates individual 
%% bibliography units for the "Kappa"-part and one for each of the papers. The
%% bibunits are created automatically and the bibliography for the kappa is 
%% added automatically too. However, in the papers you have to issue a '\putbib'
%% command at the place where you want the bibliography to appear.
%%
%% '\defaultbibliograph' and '\defaultbibliographystyle' define the default
%% bibliography file and style used for the entire document if no other
%% bibliography and/or style is specified within the respective bibunit.
%%
%% Finally, bibunits creates a set of bibliography files called 'buX.aux', one 
%% for each bibunit. You have to run bibtex on each of them to genereate the
%% corresponding bbl-file. On Linux I use the following script (which is
%% involved as a post-processor after pdflatex in my editor:
%%
%%     # !/bin/bash
%%    for file in bu*.aux; do
%%        bibtex $file
%%    done;
%%
%% Details about all this can be found in the bibunits manual.

\defaultbibliographystyle{IEEEtran}

%% Kappa
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The 'kappa' part of the thesis is put into the 'intro' environment. This
%% environment makes sure that all the formatting, etc. is setup correctly.
%% After that it's just a matter of including the different chapters.
\begin{intro}
\input{Kappa/introduction}
\input{Kappa/usage}
\end{intro}


%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Papers
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Similarly to the 'intro'-environment, the 'papers'-environment sets up the
%% whole paper part with all the necessary formatting, etc.
\begin{papers}

%% Papers are included using the '\includepaper'-command. It uses the key-value
%% options format similar to many other LaTeX commands (e.g. \includegraphics).
%% The keys are:
%% 
%%     * title        The paper title
%%     * author       The paper author(s), use curly brackets for a comma-
%%                    separated list of authors
%%     * journal      The journal where the article was published
%%     * conference   The conference where the article was published
%%     * copyright    The copyright holder
%%     * published    For a published paper
%%     * accepted     For an accepted paper
%%     * submitted    For a submitted paper
%%
%% The main argument to the \includepaper-command is then the paper's main
%% file. This is supposed to be very slim, see Example/PaperA/main.tex or
%% Example/PaperB/main.tex. All the titles, etc. are typeset automatically.

%% Paper A: First Example Paper
\includepaper[title=An Example Paper,
	author={Author A and Author B},
	journal=A Journal of Important Studies,
	copyright={2012, The Institution of Important Studies},
	published]{PaperA/main}

%% Paper B: Second Example Paper
\includepaper[title=Another Example Paper,
	author={Author A, Author B, and Author C},
	conference={1st Conference on \LaTeX~Templates},
	copyright={2012, International \LaTeX~Federation},
	published]{PaperB/main}
