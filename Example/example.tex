% ltuthesis.cls Example %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is an example and documentation to show and document the 'ltuthesis.cls'
% LaTeX class. It can be used as a starting point for writing your own thesis.
%
% IMPORTANT NOTICE: The template and its features are thoroughly described in
% the PDF produced by this example. Please refer to this documentation first.
%
% In order to build the example, run ...
%
% TODO 
%   [ ] Include the commands required to compile this example. Also, include a
%       makefile.
%   [ ] I might want to include the option of creating the library-style front-
%       page in order to publish it myself.

% Document Class Definition %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Define the document class to use. Just as for the book class, we define a two-
% sided layout where chapters start on right-handed pages. Furthermore, we use 
% A4 paper and 12pt fonts. Of course other options can be used.
%
% Finally, the 'thumbmarks' option instructs the template to place thumbmarks on
% for easy navigation (optional of course).
%\documentclass[twoside,openright,12pt,a4paper]{ltuthesis}
\documentclass[twoside,openright,12pt,a4paper,thumbmarks]{ltuthesis}


% Load Packages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Here, we load the packages required by the thesis. None of the packages is re-
% quired by the template as the required packages are loaded by the class file 
% itself. However, the packages loaded below give you a good starting point.

% Input encoding
% Most modern OSes use UTF-8 and the template is written in UTF-8, however, 
% others should work too.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% To fix block alignment
\usepackage{microtype}

% hyperref
% Practical if you want a PDF with links and an index.
\usepackage[plainpages=false,pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
    % General appearance when opening the PDF
    % bookmarks=true,% show bookmarks bar?
    unicode=false,                                % Use non-Latin characters in bookmarks?

    pdfmenubar=true,                              % show Acrobat's menu?
    pdffitwindow=false,                           % Window fit to page when opened
    pdfstartview={FitH},                          % Fits the width of the page to the window

% appendix
% If you have appendices in your articles, you can use the 'appendix' package
% to make them appear in the correct format. Include the following lines:
\usepackage{appendix}
\renewcommand{\setthesection}{\Alph{section}}
\renewcommand*{\theHchapter}{\thepart.\thechapter}


% lipsum
% This package is to generate (realistic) arbitrary text, simply remove it.
\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{language=[LaTeX]TeX}

\usepackage{color}

% Bibliography Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The bibliography is handled by the 'bibunits' package which creates individual
% bibliographies, one for the kappa and one for each of the papers. These are 
% created automagically and the bibliography for the kappa is added 
% automatically after the last chapter of the kappa. However, in the papers you
% have to issue a '\putbib' command at the place where you want the bibliography
% to appear, see the example papers included.
%
% '\defaultbibliograph' and '\defaultbibliographystyle' define the default
% bibliography file and style used for the entire document if no other
% bibliography and/or style is specified within the respective bibunit. The 
% latter is advanced and the user is referred to the bibunits documentation.
%
% Finally, bibunits creates a set of bibliography files called 'buX.aux', one 
% for each bibunit. You have to run bibtex on each of them to genereate the
% corresponding bbl-file. On Linux I use the following script (which is
% involved as a post-processor after pdflatex in my editor:
%
%     # !/bin/bash
%    for file in bu*.aux; do
%        bibtex $file
%    done;
%
% Details about all this can be found in the bibunits manual.
\defaultbibliography{example}
\defaultbibliographystyle{IEEEtran}

% Kappa %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The kappa of the theisis is put into the 'intro' environment as shown below.
% This ensures that all the formatting, etc. is setup correctly and it's just a
% matter of including the different chapters. 
\begin{intro}
    \input{Kappa/introduction}
    \input{Kappa/usage}
    \input{Kappa/tipstricks}
\end{intro}


% Papers %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Similarly to the 'intro'-environment, the included papers are put into a 
% 'papers'-environment. Again, this sets up all the formatting, counters, etc.
\begin{papers}

% Papers themselves are included using the '\includepaper'-command. It uses the 
% key-value options format as used in many other LaTeX commands (for example 
% \includegraphics). Some of the keys are required while others complement each
% other. Different examples are given below.
%
% The keys are:
%   * title        The paper title
%   * author       The paper author(s), use curly brackets for a comma-
%                  separated list of authors
%   * journal      The journal where the article was/is going to be published
%                  (only if the paper is a journal paper)
%   * conference   The conference where the article was/is going to be published
%                  (only if the paper is a conference paper)
%   * copyright    The copyright holder (only if the copyright has been trans-
%                  ferred).
%   * published    For a published paper.
%   * accepted     For an accepted paper.
%   * submitted    For a submitted paper.
%   * doi          The digital object identifier (DOI), for published papers
%                  papers only.
%
% The main argument to the \includepaper-command is then the paper's main
% file. This is supposed to be very slim, see Example/Paper A/main.tex or
% Example/Paper B/main.tex. All the titles, etc. are typeset automatically.

% Example Paper A: Published conference paper
\includepaper[title={The First Example Paper},
    author={Author A and Author B},
    conference={54th Conference on LaTeX Templates},
    copyright={2012, The Institute of All Things LaTeX},
    published,
    doi={2012/ABC}]{PaperA/main}

% Example Paper B: Accepted journal paper
\includepaper[title={The Second Example Paper},
	author={Author A, Author C, and Author B},
	journal={The International Journal of LaTeX Templates},
	copyright={2012, The Institute of All Things LaTeX},
	accepted]{PaperB/main}

% Example Paper C: Submitted conference paper
\includepaper[title={The Third Example Paper},
	author={Author A, Author B, and Author C},
	conference={1st Symposium on LaTeX Templates},
	submitted]{PaperC/main}

\end{papers}
